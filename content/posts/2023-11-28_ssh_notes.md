## 生成一个 SSH key

最简单的生成一个 ssh key 的方法：`ssh-keygen -C "my ssh key"`

- `-c`: comment. Provides a comment for this key.

较常用的生成一个 ssh key 的方法（自定义 key 的类型/算法）：`ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "my ssh key"`

- `-t`: Specify the type of the key to create. The possible values are “dsa”, “ecdsa”, “ecdsa-sk”, “ed25519”, “ed25519-sk”, or “rsa”..

---

Public Key Access:
- A user creates a pair of public and private keys, and installs the public key in his **$HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys** file on the target server. 然后这个 public key 对应的 private key 的所有者（的设备/machine）就可以随意访问这个 target server 了。
- A public key consist of:
	- type
	- key (itself)
	- comment
	- For example: `ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIEMucCYHaP8lU+zBeeP6ps7DsT7ViZCvWK1UOiaNaSyg mbp`

**authorized_keys:**

The "authorized_keys" file on the remote server is used for manage "who" can access to that server, right?

Exactly, that's correct. The `authorized_keys` file on the remote server is used to manage access by specifying which public keys are allowed to connect to a particular user's account on that server. Each line in the `authorized_keys` file typically represents a public key that is authorized to access the associated user account. By adding or removing public keys in this file, administrators can control and manage who has permission to log in to the server using SSH.

> The file `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` lists the public keys that are permitted for logging in. When the user logs in, the ssh > program tells the server which key pair it would like to use for authentication. The client proves that it has access to the private key and the server checks that the corresponding public key is authorized to accept the account. — `man ssh` | AUTHENTICATION

如果我尝试 access 一台 remote server，但我本地没有配置任何 ssh key，`.ssh` 文件夹都是空的。这个时候 authentication **fall back** 为 username/password access。你需要输入 remote server 的 login password 来 ssh in。

---

- `ssh-add`: add my ssh private key to ssh-agent。让 ssh-agent 来保管我的 private key。这个命令需要你输入 ssh private key 的 passphrase。
- `ssh-add -l`: Lists fingerprints of all identities currently represented by the agent. 列出当前被添加到 ssh-agent 的 ssh (private) key。

---

`SSH_AUTH_SOCK` environment variable: Identifies the path of a UNIX-domain socket used to communicate with the agent.

---

可以在 `~/.ssh/config` 文件里设置的东西，可以在 `man ssh_config` 里找到。里面有所有可以通过 `config` 文件设置的东西。

SSH authentication methods (Authentication methods are tried in the order specified below):

1. Host-based authentication: Host-based authentication works as follows: If the machine the user logs in from is listed in `/etc/hosts.equiv` or `/etc/ssh/shosts.equiv` on the remote machine, the user is non-root and the user names are the same on both sides, or if the files `~/.rhosts` or `~/.shosts` exist in the user's home directory on the remote machine and contain a line containing the name of the client machine and the name of the user on that machine, the user is considered for login.
2. Public key authentication
3. Keyboard-interactive authentication: The server sends an arbitrary "challenge" text and prompts for a response, possibly multiple times.
4. Password authentication

---

To allow access for only specific users:

- Edit this file: `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`.
- Append `AllowUsers user1 user2` to it.

> ⬆️ This keyword can be followed by a list of user name patterns, separated by spaces.

More info can be fonud in sshd_config man page: `man sshd_config`.

---

ssh automatically maintains and checks a database containing **identification for all hosts it has ever been used with**（所以 known_host 文件包含的是内容是这个意思）。Any new hosts are automatically added to the user's file (known_host file).
