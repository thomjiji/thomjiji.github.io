# Publishing Process

1. After making any changes (such as adding new posts, adjusting styles, etc.), first 
   perform a commit.

   ```shell
   git commit -m ""
   ```

1. Next, build the entire site with the new changes. The static site will be built into
   the `docs/` directory (for the GitHub page). Hugo default is `public/`.

   ```shell
   hugo
   ```

2. Finally, commit once more to upload the built static site to GitHub.

   ```shell
   git commit -m "<message> build"
   ```

# Serve localhost

```shell
hugo server -D
```

# Add new post

```shell
hugo new posts/new_post.md
```

# Clean up before rebuild

Hugo will not automatically clean up static site in the `public/` directory for you, so
every time you rebuild, the new content will be mixed with the old content. Although it
rarely causes conflicts, it is better to run before rebuilding: `rm -rf public/` â€” with 
cautious!
